# ðŸŽƒ Postman API-First Hacktoberfest for Students - 2021

## Technologies

## Requirements

You can use ANY tech stack you want, as long your server matches the schema with 7 endpoints, and passes all the tests.

Endpoints:
- [ ] GET /
- [ ] GET /contestants
- [ ] GET /contestants/:id
- [ ] PATCH /contestants/:id
- [ ] DELETE /contestants/:id
- [ ] POST /contestants
- [ ] PATCH /contestants/:id/upvote


To see what types of responses your API should return, check out the [schema](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-hacktoberfest-21/api/b8ee9c39-4eb5-46c0-94e0-d643d9064ba9/version/77aea2ac-8b58-4314-82a6-847b40547c1f?tab=define) or [documentation](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-hacktoberfest-21/documentation/15567703-097eb31d-3c5a-4b40-90de-870efc823a94). 

Your API will need to pass the series of tests in this collection when run with the [Collection Runner](https://learning.postman.com/docs/running-collections/intro-to-collection-runs/): [Test collection](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-hacktoberfest-21/collection/15567703-96f91b20-f497-43aa-a7f9-f1443bdd3a71?ctx=documentation)

Submit your repo [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeg8BVdg3fzuhwgBiM6AXR_NOEKI-w_Q8uG5eBVpfyVZmggXw/viewform), once you've completed building an API or Website that meets the requirements!
